FreeHealthFoundation
====================

Free Health Foundation (FHF) is a nonprofit to promote freedom and to promote Health Related Free Software and Open Source Hardware Development. The name Free Health Foundation is inspired by Richard Stallman’s crusade for Free Softwares to give the computer user freedom and protect from Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and software patent. However, Free Health Foundation has no official relationship with The Free Software Foundation (FSF), although Free Health Foundation (FHF) strictly follows the motive and way of running campaigns just like Free Software Foundation (FSF) with some health specific Management.


Who Can Join FreeHealthFoundation ?
===================================


Who Why Can Not Join FreeHealthFoundation ? There are some restrictions.
All developers, contributers are welcome. There are two segments of FreeHealthFoundation members - (A) Developers (B) Academicians.
