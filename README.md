FreeHealthFoundation
====================

Free Health Foundation (FHF) is a nonprofit to promote freedom and to promote Health Related Free Software and Open Source Hardware Development. The name Free Health Foundation is inspired by Richard Stallmanâ€™s crusade for Free Softwares to give the computer user freedom and protect from Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and software patent. However, Free Health Foundation has no official relationship with The Free Software Foundation (FSF), although Free Health Foundation (FHF) strictly follows the motive and way of running campaigns just like Free Software Foundation (FSF) with some health specific Management.

Who Why Can Not Join FreeHealthFoundation ? :D
All developers, contributers are welcome. There are two segments of FreeHealthFoundation members - (A) Developers (B) Academicians. 
While Developer Account is fully Free, Academicians profile, unless the person is a student, is paid. Payment structure and purpose is same like Free Software Fundation. This is to prevent flooding and discrimination of bad practices in Health.

This Project's Wiki and this Github repo will work as Official Website for FreeHealthFoundation, unless we are able to run the official website of [Free Health Foundation](http://freehealthfoundation.org/)
